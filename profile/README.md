# EleventhHour

EleventhHour is a GitHub organization run by two friends, created to host hackathon projects and personal builds.

This space is focused on experimenting, learning by building, and shipping ideas under real constraints. Many of our projects are created during hackathons or tight deadlines, but we still aim for clean, readable, and practical code.

## What you’ll find here

- Hackathon projects and prototypes  
- Personal and collaborative side projects  
- Experiments, tools, and proof-of-concepts  
- Learning-focused implementations  

Some projects are polished, others are raw all are part of the learning process.

## Tech Stack

There is no fixed tech stack. Repositories may include:
- Go
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Python
- Web APIs and services

Each repository documents its own stack and setup.
